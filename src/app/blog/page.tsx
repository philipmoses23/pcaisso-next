      <p>Introducing Pcaisso: an AI code + art generator based on ChatGPT! </p>
      <p>ChatGPT has an incredible ability to generate code, and I was captivated by its code generation capabilities, especially when it comes to drawing. I was very much determined to see just how far we could push the limits of GPT-3's artistic potential!</p>
      <p>So, I rallied the students of the Coding Club GCT and we formed a team to work on this project during our spare time. It was a thrilling adventure for all of us, and we built this tool from scratch! It was an experiment like no other, but with the help of my dedicated team, we made it happen.</p>
      <p>And guess what? In the last few days, I've been testing out some prompts and the results were truly breathtaking! Some of the visuals that ChatGPT was able to generate left me absolutely speechless! I'm so thrilled to finally share the results with you all in the attached video. Get ready to be amazed!</p>
      <p>However, this is just a hack, and it would fail more than 60% of the time :). I am hoping GPT-4 will take it to the next level, judging by what I read in the Sparks of AGI paper. I had applied for access but havenâ€™t got it yet. Fingers crossed OpenAI will approve my application soon.</p> 
      <p>I believe this could be a valuable tool for LLM researchers, and tinkerers. If you like to play with it, please leave a comment. I am thinking of making it open-source, and possibly hosting it online for people to tinker. We want to add a lot of features and looking forward to inviting collaborators from the broader community!</p>
